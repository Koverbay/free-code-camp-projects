      <p> Cheese was a pudding hamster who lived for approximately 2 years from 2017 to 2019. She was born in Seoul, South Korea, in a LotteMart. At just a few weeks old, she was purchased from LotteMart and went to live with her new owner. Together, they lived in several different cities within Korea.
      <br>
      Cheese was an energetic hamster who always loved to escape from her cage and go exploring. Her owner fondly remembers the time that she escaped in the middle of the night and went missing for an entire day, before being found snuggled next to the trash bags under the sink.
